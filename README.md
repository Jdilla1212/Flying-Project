# Flying-Project
Repo for our first project


## Project Title: 
Star Search

## Project Description:
An app that pulls information on the night sky and all of its features, including constellations, planets, galaxies, etc. based on location and weather conditions. 

With Star Search, a user can choose what they want to see in the night sky and it will tell them where they will be at what time.

Also, weather data gets pulled to make sure you have good visibility of what you are looking for (cloud coverage, moon phases, sunset/rise, etc.)

Apple is closing dark sky but WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK

## User Story:
As someone who like to travel, hike, experience the outdoors
I want to learn more about the universe relative to the places I travel
When i open the application
I am presented with the current astronomical data relative to my current location
When I enter a new location
I am presented with the current astronomical data relative to that location
So that I can be a more well-informed traverser of the universe
