# Flying-Project
Repo for our first project


## Project Title: 
Planet Search

## Project Description:
An app that pulls information on the planets and moons of the night sky, displaying some quick facts on whatever object you searched. It also features a built in map based off your location, and a weather tab, incase you were planning a night hike to look at the sky.

With Planet Search, a user can search for information on planets and moons in the night sky, finding quick information without sifting through all the fluff of something like a wikipedia article.

Also, weather data gets pulled to make sure you have good visibility of what you are looking for (visibility, temperature, ect.)

## User Story:
As someone who likes astronomy, the outdoors, and what's out there in space
I want to learn more about the planets in and around our solar system
When i open the application
I am presented with the current astronomical data on the planet I searched for
I can view my location on the map as well as the current weather and visibility
So that I can be a more well-informed traverser of the universe, and plan a sudden night hike if I so desire, with all the needed info in one app
